# My Website

This is the source code for my personal website.

## Overview

The website includes a navigation bar on the left with a logo and several navigation items. The main content of the site is styled to match the width of the text, and the background color is set to `#f5f5f5`.

## Structure

The website is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file for the website.
- `css/styles.css`: This file contains all the CSS styles for the website.

## Setup

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Future Improvements

Future updates will include more content and possibly some interactive features.
